It was opened to employees in April 2017, while construction was still underway. It replaced Apple Campus as the company's corporate headquarters.\nThe main building's scale and circular groundscraper design, by Norman Foster, has earned the structure the media nickname \"the spaceship\". Located on a suburban site totaling 1.46 km2 (360 acres), it houses more than 12,000 employees in one central four-story circular building of approximately 0.26 km2 (64 acres). Apple co-founder Steve Jobs wanted the campus to look less like a business park and more like a nature refuge; 80 percent of the site consists of green space planted with drought-resistant trees and plants indigenous to the Cupertino area, and the center courtyard of the main building features an artificial pond.\n\n"

          "extract": "Vallco Shopping Mall (formerly called Cupertino Square and originally Vallco Fashion Park) is a mostly-demolished dead mall located in Cupertino, California, United States. Originally built as a two-story shopping mall in 1976 with a third-level movie theater added in 2007, it was anchored for most of its existence by Macy's, Sears, and J.C. Penney. As of August 2022, the mall is owned by Sand Hill Property Co. and is almost entirely vacant, with Cupertino Ice Center (formerly the Ice Capades Chalet), Bowlmor Lanes, and Benihana as the only remaining tenants, all in the section to the east of Wolfe Road. The larger western portion of the main mall structure was demolished in August 2019, followed by the demolition of the pedestrian overpass in March 2020. Plans for the site include a mixed-use development featuring office space, housing, and retail.\nA plan by Sand Hill to rebuild Vallco as a mixed-use development with retail, housing, and office space topped by a green roof park was canceled after Cupertino voters rejected Measure D on the November 2016 ballot.  After obtaining community input in the planning phase, the project ran into significant push-back from citizens who wanted to freeze the site as retail-only, citing concerns about traffic and schools.\nIn 2018, Sand Hill proposed a revised development plan under the auspices of SB 35, which was approved by Cupertino and includes 2,402 apartments, 1.8 million square feet of office space, and 400,000 square feet of retail. Of the apartments, half of them will be affordable with no government subsidies, which would quintuple Cupertino's affordable housing stock."
